# TDD with Python and Django

## This Repo was created for add notes and things abou my Tdd learn
### I'm doing it with the book [TDD with python from Harry J.W. Percival](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781449365141/)

The book have a lot of informations about TDD and start the chapter, installing Django and Selenium, assuming that you have a python running in your machine with a virtual environment activated.

Than, we will install the Django, and Selenium with the commands 

~~~
pip install django

pip install selenium 
~~~

For we do simple things with Selenium, normally the easy way to do it, its use a local webdriver. 

So, we will use for this examples, the Firefox geckodriver. 

Download here, and set the file in your's environment variable, after you will be able to run

'''
geckodriver --version 
'''

from your terminal, and received something like this: 
~~~
geckodriver 0.26.0 (e9783a644016 2019-10-10 13:38 +0000)
